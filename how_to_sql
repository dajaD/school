This is how to have mysql 8.0 set up and compatible with RoR

I did this with linux, so you may need to translate commands, some may be the same.

1. Ensure you have mysql 8.0 installed.
2. When installing, you should have been prompted to create a root password.
3. enter 'mysql -u root -p'
   this command requires your root password from step 2.
4. You will then be in a command interface for mysql
5. enter 'create database our_db;'
   'our_db' will be the name of our database for this project.
6. enter 'use our_db;'
   this will make this db the server we'll be currently using.
7. enter 'SELECT DATABASE();'
   this will show you if 'our_db' is being used, else it will be 'null'
8. enter 'mysqladmin -u root -p status'
   this will tell you whether the database is running
9. if it isn't running, enter 'service my_sql start'
   This will start the database.
10. In the ourapp/config/database.yml will be configuration settings for
    the db. 
11. Create an environmental variable for the db root password, because 
    it is not safe to have it in plaintext.
    For temporary use you can use 'export MYSQLPW='your_pw''
    Or you can add it permanently in ~/.bashrc by putting 'export MYSQLPW='your_pw'' in there.

As I said, you may need to perform equivalent commands on your machines, or you may run into different challenges that I haven't. Good Luck!

If the db isn't properly configured, you'll get an error upon using 'localhost:3000'
